‚úÖ Insights:

    GDPR tops the list, suggesting that roles requiring expertise in data privacy and compliance command high salaries, likely due to growing legal and ethical requirements in AI and data.

    Golang (Go) appears twice under "golang" and "go", both with high averages (~$208k and ~$163k), highlighting backend system expertise as lucrative.

    Tools for automation and testing like Selenium are highly valued.

    Vision-related tools like OpenCV reflect strong demand for computer vision expertise.

üß† Notable Specialized Tools & Platforms:

    Neo4j, Redis, DynamoDB, and Cassandra: Suggest demand for professionals who understand modern databases, especially NoSQL and graph DBs.

    MicroStrategy, Looker, Qlik: High-paying roles for BI and analytics platforms, showing the value of turning data into insights for business decisions.

    Hugging Face: $163k average reflects the high demand for transformer models and NLP proficiency.
