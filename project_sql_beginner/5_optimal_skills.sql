Question: What are the most optimal skills to learn (High demand + high paying)
- Identifiy high pay and demand skills based on average salaries for a role
- Preference for remote positions with listed salaries (i.e. limiting "null" values)
- Why? Targets job security and financial benefits for insights in career development.

ðŸ“Š Takeaways:

    Best of Both Worlds:
    If you're looking for a strong combo of high salary and high demand, skills like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Spark are top contendersâ€”ideal for machine learning and big data roles.

    Specialized High Earners:
    Skills like C, Go, and Qlik command high salaries despite lower demand, likely due to niche use cases or a shortage of skilled professionals.

    Foundational Powerhouses:
    Python, SQL, and AWS dominate in demand, making them valuable for job security and flexibility, though they may not offer top-tier salaries alone.
